This is a project to analyze strategies for Quoridor game.
Currently it has full engine to run the game and support the rules (on how to move and set the fences) for 2 player game.
Project has UI part to poke around and for some sanity testing
Simple AI that runs by the shortest path

Future plan is to analyze (an potentially solve the game of quoridor for 2 players for 9x9 field).
Develop strategies for First & Second player.
Implement 4 player game and repeat everything that was done for 2 player game.
